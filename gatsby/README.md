# Quants & Quills website

This repository is the canonical source for the code and (some) content for the Quants and Quills Inc website.

## Editing content

As a general rule, content — that is, all the words and pictures, etc that aren't part of the site design — lives in the `/content` folder. So if you need to edit something, that's probably where to look.

## Development

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

To work on the site, clone this repository and fire it up in NodeJS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantsquills/quantsquills.com.git
cd quantsquills.com
npm install
npm run dev
```
