	<h1>Volunteering</h1>
	<p>
		Thanks for being part of the <strong>Hacks/Hackers Brisbane</strong>{' '}
		community!
	</p>
	<p>
		Each event that we put on takes a considerable amount of work and
		coordination, so we're always keen to hear from people who are willing to
		help out the core group of organisers in any way — large or small.

	<div>
		<p
			>There are a variety of things we could use some help with both <a
				href="#event-help">on the day</a>
			of events and <a href="#organising-help">between events</a>. If you are
			willing to help out with any of these tasks, we'd love to hear from you

		<h4>Creating promotional material</h4>
		<p
			>Got marketing or copywriting skills? Creating event flyers and writing
			event descriptions.</p>
		<h4>Event writeups</h4>
		<p
			>We love writups of our events. We try to get a writup into our post-event <a
				href="/newsletter">newsletter</a> and love just as much seeing writeups elsewhere.</p>
	</div>
	<SectionTitle name="#event-help">On the day</SectionTitle>
	<div>
		<h4>Venue setup</h4>
		<p
			>Putting out chairs and setting up tables for the food and drinks. Setting
			up the projector, etc.</p>
		<h4>Photographer</h4>
		<p
			>If you're a photography pro (or aspiring to be one) having great photos
			of our events makes a huge difference.</p>
		<h4>Greeter</h4>
		<p
			>This involves checking attendees off against the RSVP list. Bonus — you
			get to say hello to everyone there!</p>
		<h4>Cammo</h4>
		<p>Do you have sound/video recording skills (or a desire to build them?)</p>
		<h4>Live tweeting</h4>
		<p
			>Live tweet the event either from your own account, or we can give you
			access to @HacksHackersBrisbane for the night.</p>
		<h4>Packing up</h4>
		<p
			>Many hands make light work when packing up at the end of an event. If you
			can hang around for a bit that would be awesome.</p>
