	<h1>Volunteering</h1>
	<p>
		Thanks for being part of the <strong>Hacks/Hackers Brisbane</strong>{' '}
		community!
	</p>
	<p>
		Each event that we put on takes a considerable amount of work and
		coordination, so we're always keen to hear from people who are willing to
		help out the core group of organisers in any way â€” large or small.
